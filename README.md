## About

This is a video game engine based on web technologies and geared towards the creation of 2D visual novel-type games.

A semi-custom scripting language has been designed for building code that is interpreted and executed by the engine and is also interoperable with JavaScript code.

Wails is used to package the project and manage multimedia resources in the device's storage.
